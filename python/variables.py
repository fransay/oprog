# A variable is a container that stores a data of certain type.
# storage units -> bits
# naming of variables
# variables can store different data types 

name_of_student = "Francis." # 7 bits # 1/2 bit for a single character, almost like 1 byte = 8 bits
# 8 bits = 1 byte
print(name_of_student) # output name_of_student

age_of_student = 12 # declaring a variable and assigning it to 12, type of 12 is an integer

age_of_teacher = 30 # declaring a variable and assigning it to 30, type of 30 is an integer
