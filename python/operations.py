# Operations

# f(x) => x**2 ==> y
# f(x)=y
# f(2) = 2**2 = 4

# f(x) = x ==>y
# f(2) = 2 = 2

# Operators: Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise 

a = 1
b = 2 
c = a + b  # addition
c = a - b  # substraction
c = a * b  # multiplication
c = a / b  # division
c = a > b  # comparison
c = a >= b 

# Logic AND , OR ops

a = "1" # false
b = 1 # true
c = a and b # value or c here will be == b
c = a or b

# look more on short circuting
# bitwise... low level stuff
a = 15
